TCLAP - Templatized Command Line Argument Parser

This is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner.  It doesn't conform exactly
to either the GNU or POSIX standards, although it is close.  See
docs/manual.html for descriptions of how things work or look at the
simple examples in the examples dir.

This is another fork trying to accumulate all github's changes in
a single repository.

The original development at http://tclap.sourceforge.net
by Michael E. Smoot.
